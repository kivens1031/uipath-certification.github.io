 A company operates an application on Amazon EC2 instances, utilizing an Amazon Aurora database. Currently, the EC2 instances connect to the database using usernames and passwords stored in a local file. To reduce the operational burden associated with credential management, what steps should a solutions architect take to achieve this objective?

A
{: .answer}

The correct answer is **A. Utilize AWS Secrets Manager and enable automatic rotation.**

### Explanation of the Correct Answer:

1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: This service is specifically designed for managing secrets, such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. It provides a secure way to store, retrieve, and manage these secrets, which significantly reduces the operational overhead associated with credential management.

2. **Automatic Rotation**: AWS Secrets Manager can automatically rotate secrets on a specified schedule without requiring any human intervention. This means that your EC2 instances can always access up-to-date credentials without manual updates, enhancing security and reducing the risk of credential exposure.

3. **Integration with AWS Services**: Secrets Manager integrates easily with other AWS services, including Amazon Aurora. Applications running on EC2 can retrieve secrets through the AWS SDKs or the AWS CLI, which simplifies the development process.

4. **Audit and Compliance**: Secrets Manager provides access logs through AWS CloudTrail, allowing for easy tracking of access and modifications to secrets, which is essential for compliance and security audits.

### Why the Other Options are Incorrect:

**B. Utilize AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and enable automatic rotation.**
- **Limitations**: While AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store can store sensitive information and supports encryption, it does not have built-in automatic rotation for secrets. You would need to implement your own mechanism for rotating credentials, which adds complexity and operational overhead.
- **Use Case**: Parameter Store is more suitable for storing configuration data or less sensitive information rather than for managing critical secrets.

**C. Set up an Amazon S3 bucket for storing objects that utilize an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Transfer the credential file to the S3 bucket. Configure the application to reference the S3 bucket.**
- **Security Concerns**: Storing credentials in S3, even with KMS encryption, is not a recommended best practice for managing secrets. It requires additional management for access control, and there‚Äôs a risk of exposing the credentials if the S3 bucket permissions are misconfigured.
- **Operational Overhead**: This solution does not provide automatic rotation of secrets and requires the application to manage the retrieval of the credentials, which increases complexity.

**D. For each EC2 instance, generate an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Connect the newly created EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Transfer the credential file to this new EBS volume. Direct the application to utilize the new EBS volume.**
- **Complexity and Management**: This approach increases operational overhead as it requires managing EBS volumes for each EC2 instance. Each instance would need to be configured to mount the volume, adding complexity to the deployment process.
- **Lack of Rotation**: Like the other options, this method does not support automatic rotation of credentials, which is a key benefit that AWS Secrets Manager provides.

### Key Technical Details for AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam:

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Understand its features, such as secret versioning, automatic rotation, and integration with AWS services.
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**: Know the differences between parameter types (SecureString vs. String), and use cases.
- **S3 Bucket Security**: Be aware of IAM policies and bucket policies that govern access to S3 objects, and understand best practices for storing sensitive data.
- **Amazon EBS**: Familiarize yourself with EBS volume types, encryption options, and management practices.

For the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam, be prepared to discuss best practices for managing secrets in AWS and the trade-offs of different approaches, particularly focusing on security, operational overhead, and compliance.

Option B is incorrect because AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store does not natively support automatic rotation of credentials unless the user implements a custom solution. Option A is the preferred approach, as it leverages AWS Secrets Manager, which provides built-in functionality for automatic rotation of secrets, thereby reducing the operational overhead associated with credential management. Utilizing AWS Secrets Manager enhances security by allowing the application to retrieve credentials dynamically while minimizing the risks associated with hardcoding sensitive information. This solution not only streamlines the management of database credentials but also adheres to best practices for security and compliance in cloud environments.
