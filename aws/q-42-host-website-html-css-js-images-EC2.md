B
{: .answer}

The correct answer to the question of the most cost-effective method for hosting a static website consisting of HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images is **B. Set up an Amazon S3 bucket and use it to host the website.**

### Explanation of the Correct Answer (B)

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. The key reasons why hosting a static website on an S3 bucket is the most cost-effective option are:

1. **Static Site Hosting**: S3 is designed for hosting static websites, which means that there is no need for a server-side processing capability. You can upload your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images directly to S3 and serve them directly to users.

2. **Cost-Effective Pricing**: S3 charges based on storage used and outbound data transfer. For a static website with relatively low traffic, the costs are minimal compared to running a full-fledged server. There are no charges for inbound data transfer, and the pricing for data retrieval and storage is quite economical.

3. **No Server Management**: Thereâ€™s no need to manage, patch, or scale servers, which reduces operational overhead and complexity. This is especially beneficial for small teams or projects where resource management is a concern.

4. **Global Distribution with CloudFront**: S3 can be easily integrated with Amazon CloudFront, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), which can further reduce latency and improve load times for users accessing the site from different geographical locations.

5. **High Availability and Durability**: S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability, ensuring that your website will be reliably available.

### Explanation of Why the Other Answers Are Incorrect

**A. Package the website into a container and deploy it on AWS Fargate.**
- **Complexity and Cost**: While Fargate allows for serverless container hosting, it is generally overkill for a simple static website. It incurs additional costs associated with running containers and requires knowledge of containerization, orchestration, and potentially more complex deployment processes. For static content, S3 is a far more straightforward and cheaper solution.

**C. Set up a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to serve the website.**
- **Higher Management Overhead**: While EC2 can serve static files, it requires you to provision, configure, and manage a virtual server. This includes setting up a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), applying security patches, and scaling as traffic changes. These tasks add operational complexity and costs that are unnecessary for a simple static website.

**D. Set up an Application Load Balancer that directs traffic to an AWS Lambda target utilizing the Express.js framework.**
- **Unnecessary Overhead for Static Content**: This option involves unnecessary complexity for static content. Using an Application Load Balancer and AWS Lambda introduces additional costs and management overhead. Lambda functions are designed for serverless compute and are more suited for dynamic content or APIs rather than serving static files.

### Technical Details for AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam

- **S3 Bucket Configuration**: To host a static website on S3, you need to enable static website hosting in the S3 bucket settings, specify an index document (e.g., `index.html`), and optionally an error document. Ensure that the bucket policy allows public access if the content needs to be accessible to anyone.

- **Cost Management**: Understand the S3 pricing model, which includes charges for storage, GET requests, PUT requests, and data transfer out of S3. Familiarize yourself with the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs.

- **CloudFront**: Know how to set up CloudFront for better performance and caching of static assets. This can significantly lower data transfer costs and improve user experience through reduced latency.

- **Security**: Be aware of how to configure bucket policies and permissions to secure your S3 bucket. Learn about the importance of using HTTPS and potential implications of public access.

By understanding these concepts, you'll be better prepared to select the most appropriate and cost-effective solution for hosting web content in an AWS environment.
