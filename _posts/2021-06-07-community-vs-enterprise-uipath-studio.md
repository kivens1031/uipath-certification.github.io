## Transcript 
So, looking at my screen, can you tell whether I am using UiPath Studio **Community edition** or UiPath Studio, **Enterprise edition** , but the fact of the matter is you cannot and you can even dig in a little bit deeper. You can look at the different activities, the Programming activities, the UiPath, UiPath Automation activities.

You can look at the User Event activities and all the different facilities for creating attended, and unattended UiPath robots. And you are not going to be able to tell whether you are working on the Community edition or the Enterprise edition of UiPath studio, even looking at the dependencies there.

There is no indicator. I mean, you can dig down. If you go home. I can see in this bottom left-hand corner; it actually says I'm using 21.4 Community edition. But the bottom line is anything that you can do with the Community edition you can do with the Enterprise edition and on the _UiPath Certification exam_.

Occasionally they will ask questions like that. They will say, hey, you know, if you create something in the Community studio, can you publish it to **_Orchestrator_** or can it take advantage of a queue or can it do this, or can it do that? The fact of the matter is anything that you create with the Community edition of studio can do the same thing that something created with the Enterprise edition of studio can do.

And in the exam, they may test you on that and what they want to know is that, you know, that the Enterprise edition and the Community edition are creating the exact same robots. Now, having said that. There are a few differences between the two. One of the differences is of course just the _licensing Community edition is always free_.

However, you have to pay for the Enterprise edition of studio or use a _60-day trial_. So that is one of the differences. **_Another big difference between UiPath studio, Community and UiPath Enterprise is the fact that with UiPath Community, it always forces you to be in the latest update. So, if a new version of UiPath studio comes out, and you are using an older version. You will automatically be upgraded._** Now there is a problem with that, especially if you are trying to study for the UiPath certification exam and the problem with that is if you are using the Community edition, well, it will already updated itself to 21.4 and the exam actually tests you on 20.8. So how do you actually get an older version of UiPath studio?

_The only way to use an older version and download an older version of UiPath studio is to have an Enterprise license that could either be a paid license or a 60-day trial. But you need an Enterprise edition_. If you do have an Enterprise trial or an Enterprise license, you can download older versions of UiPath studio and so for example, right here, I have actually got UiPath automation cloud opened up for a user that just has a basic license. If I go down to admin and look at license, you can see it is the Community plan and if I go down to help over here, notice it says just, Hey. Feel free to download the Community edition.

On the other hand, I have logged in with a different user over here, inside a Firefox. If I go to admin and look at the UiPath studio license, you can see it is an Enterprise trial and because it is an Enterprise trial, if I click help over here, notice that I've got the option to download other versions of UiPath studio.

If I click on this link, you will notice that versions 20.10, 20.4, 19.10 and 18.4 are all available to me. Those are not available. If you're working with a Community edition, look at the difference between these two pages here. And so those are some of the key differences between UiPath studio, Community edition and UiPath studio Enterprise edition.

Now I will say that if you are studying for the UiPath associate exam, feel free to use 21.4. **_The biggest change is just the look of the icon in the windows task bar tray_**. The tools are virtually identical. There are a few changes, but they are not going to be noteworthy for the UiPath associate certification exam.

So, if you are studying for the UiPath certified associate exam version 20.8. Feel free to use Community edition 21.4. You will be able to learn everything you need for the exam. If you are persnickety and you want to use an older version of UiPath studio, then register for a trial version and download 20.8, install it and study with that.

But there you go. Those are the key differences between UiPath studio, Community edition and the Enterprise edition.
